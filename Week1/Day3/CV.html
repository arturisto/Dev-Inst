            I am pattionate about my wife, coding, food and travel ( in this order).
            My hobbies include food blogging, cooking, working out and planning the next vacation.
            Web Development is something that I tried many years ago and then had to put off untill recently.
            During my latest studies I have made a portfolio of different interesting items
            which can be found on github in the links section.
