    <h1> The Lions </h1>
    <hr/>
    Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and
    savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal
    than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night
     and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related
     females and cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20
     adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability.
     Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates,
     including antelope, deer, buffalo,  zebra and even giraffe.
